Custom Java Annotations

This repository contains simple Java annotations that might be useful in their own right, but which also demonstrate how easy it is to write Java annotations.

The blog post [What Might a New @Deprecated Look Like?](https://marxsoftware.blogspot.com/2015/11/what-might-new-deprecated-look-like.html) contains an example of a custom @Deprecated annotation that reflected the current proposal for enhanced deprecation at that time (the actual enhanced @Deprecation's improvements were much less ambitious).
